I asked her about Charles. But she looked a litte confused and said: “There is no one called Charles in the class.” Then I talked about what Charles had done as my son told me before.
After listening what I had said, the teacher seemed to understand what had happened. She smiled and said to me: “I know who is Charles now. He is Lorry indeed.”
My eyes widened and hardly believed what I had heard. Then the teacher told me everything about my son. And finally, she said to me: “Lorry has changed a lot, I hope that you have noticed it. And now it’s the very time to built up one’s personality, it’s very important that someone is leading him to the right direction. I think you need to have a talk with him.”
I showed my thanks to the teacher and hurried up to home. And my husband seemed to have been waiting for me for a long time.
“Welcome back, dear Charles’s mother.” He said to me once I opened the door.
“How did you know that? Did the teacher call you on my way back to home,” I asked surprisingly.
My husband laughed and asked me to sit down with him, saying: “I have noticed it before. Because I have experied this period of time when I was young. I quite understand that why our son have behaviored in that way. The only thing he wanted to get was our attention. He hoped we would notice his change and do something to it. But we neglected it.”
After I had talked with my husband, I felt a little shamed; however, I knew what I should do as a good mother.
That night, I made a cup of coffee and came into my son’s room. I told him story made up by myself but also about Charles. The story was about Charles’s change, and finally Charles became the good one only.
And my son seemed to understand what I really wanted to say. From then on, the word Charles was disappeared in our life. All that we had heard is about what Lorry had done at school.
