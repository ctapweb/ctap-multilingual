 “My dear teacher, I’ve got a question for you,” I said. As the teacher found me, he said with a pleasant voice, “Oh, it’s you, Lorry’s mother, isn’t it?”
“Yes, I am.” I replied.
“Lorry is really a good boy,” he continued “help others, never be late for school, and he is very polite to everyone!” Hearing the teacher praising my baby, I was first surprised, then frightened. “Are you saying Lorry, I never knew he was such a good guy. Woo, you see, I’ve got a happy surprise!”
“Oh, by the way,” When the name “Charles” suddenly came to me, I asked, “Who is Charles’s mother? I want to talk over with her.”
“Charles? He wondered. “There is no Charles in this class”.
“What? How could it be?” This time I was both surprised and confused.
“Sorry to pardon you,” I said and then went back home with thoughtless heart.
I told all the thing to my husband, he was anxtious. We decided to enter Lorry’s bedroom to find some clue. As we opened his drawer, we found a diary at the bottom of the drawer. I’ve never thought Lorry would keep diary, we know too little about him.
At the moment we opened up the diary, we heard the sound of shutting the door, it was Lorry. We put back the diary and shut the draw hastily, and then ran out of the bedroom in no time.
Thanks god! Lorry did not found that we had entered his room. He sat on the sofa, with one leg on the front table. Then, the words “good boy” came to me.
“I went to the parent-teacher’s meeting, Lorry.” I started.
“So what?” He said, while eyes still focusing on TV screen.
“Your teacher said you are a “good boy”…
“Ha, ha…” Lorry interrupted me, “Yes, I’m the so-called good boy.”
