The teacher seemed to wait for Charles’ mother exhaustedly, and I went up to her, “Nice to meet you. I’m Lorry’s mother.”
“Nice to meet you, Mrs. Li. Lorry’s a good boy and you’re a lucky mother.”
“Thank you, I heard something about Charles from Lorry and I feel pity, has his mother come here?”
“Not yet, I’m waiting for her for a long time. Charles is a quite strange boy.”
“T the beginning of this term, he is relatively bad, extremely naughty: played tricks on teachers and classmates, threw chalk from the blackboard, spoke loudly in school. Nobody can be rougher than he,” the teacher said with frown on her forehead, “Later, the situation got a bit better, he helped the other students and teaches and we all praised him, which happens after a big punishment to him, while now he becomes bag again. So we really want to see his mother to integate into the situation where needs efforts from both side indeed,” the teacher said seriously and raised her voice genuarily, “Now, Charles has made bad influence on other students, and our teachers are questioned and accused by other parents. You know, with one-side efforts are far from enough.” I nodded my head in approval, the teacher stopped for a while, then she outbursted a word, “Oh, it’s so late now, how can his mother do not come here, we have rang her a lot of times!”
I felt more curious about Charles’ background. How his mother would look like? Did she teach Charles’ good behaviours, or always hit Charles? 
I said goodbye to the teacher and then went home with my husband, he said, “Did you get something about Charles from the teacher?”
“It seems just as Lorry said.”
The next afternoon, Lorry rushed into the house with brighted up face. He couldn’t wait to give a word, “Teacher has visited Charles’ home!” “What?” I said and my husband raise his frown.
